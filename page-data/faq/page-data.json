At this point, BlepOMH does not use machine learning or AI to trade for you.</p>\n<h2>Do you hold user funds?</h2>\n<p>No! We want to reduce the counterparty risk as much as possible</p>\n<h2>Why is Blep's domain Blep.AI? Is there some sort of AI component?</h2>\n<p>Not currently. In the future, we may include some AI to optimize order entries and other micro optimizations. Blep does not intend to make overall trading decisions on users' behalf.</p>\n<h2>What is needed to get started?</h2>\n<p>You will need an active account on any supported exchange, and an API key.</p>\n<h2>Why do you need my API key?</h2>\n<p>In order to manage orders through our system, we need access to your account. We DO NOT need withdrawal permissions (and would highly recommend disabling those) - we only need the permissions to submit, cancel, and read orders.</p>\n<h2>But other services don't require it!</h2>\n<p>We understand and share your concern regarding API keys; unfortunately they are necessary in order to submit orders when you are offline. For example, given a single Entry, Take Profit, and Stop Loss setup:</p>\n<pre><code>if entry is executed:\n    submit tp and sl orders\nelse\n    wait\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example, the computer/server that is waiting for the entry order to be executed must be online at all times, and have the API key to submit additional orders (ie the tp and sl orders).</p>\n<h2>When do you launch?</h2>\n<p>That is TBD. We're still in the early stages but make sure to subscribe to our email list or join our telegram group at <a href=\"https://t.me/blepai\">https://t.me/blepai</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>How do I get more info?</h2>\n<p>Please message us in our Telegram group or email us at info@blep.ai! Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Blep FAQ","meta_title":"FAQ | Blep","meta_description":"How do I get started?"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"447b048d-77fa-5fb7-a6bd-15ef72abeb27"}}}
